# Reaction Sound Files

This directory should contain the following sound files for reactions:

- `thumbs-up.mp3` or `thumbs-up.wav` - Sound for 👍 reaction
- `heart.mp3` or `heart.wav` - Sound for ❤️ reaction
- `laughing.mp3` or `laughing.wav` - Sound for 😂 reaction
- `surprised.mp3` or `surprised.wav` - Sound for 😮 reaction
- `clapping.mp3` or `clapping.wav` - Sound for 👏 reaction
- `celebration.mp3` or `celebration.wav` - Sound for 🎉 reaction

Note: The application will gracefully handle missing sound files by logging warnings. You can add your own sound files here.
