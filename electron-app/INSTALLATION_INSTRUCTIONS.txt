                    ALMAJD MEET DESKTOP - INSTALLATION
================================================================================

Thank you for choosing Almajd Meet Desktop!

Follow these simple steps to install:


STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR ANTIVIRUS (IMPORTANT!)
--------------------------------------------
To prevent your antivirus from deleting the app:

1. Open your antivirus software (Windows Defender, Avast, Norton, etc.)
2. Go to "Exclusions" or "Whitelist" settings
3. Add your Downloads folder to exclusions
4. This prevents the app from being deleted

Windows Defender Quick Steps:
  • Press Windows key + I (Settings)
  • Go to "Update & Security" → "Windows Security"
  • Click "Virus & threat protection"
  • Scroll to "Exclusions" → "Add or remove exclusions"
  • Add "Downloads" folder


STEP 2: EXTRACT THE ZIP FILE
-----------------------------
1. Locate the downloaded file: "Almajd Meet-1.0.0-win.zip"
2. Right-click on the ZIP file
3. Select "Extract All..."
4. Choose where to extract (recommend: Desktop or C:\Program Files)
5. Click "Extract"


STEP 3: LAUNCH THE APPLICATION
-------------------------------
1. Open the extracted folder
2. Find "Almajd Meet.exe"
3. Double-click to run

If Windows shows a security warning:
  • Click "More info"
  • Click "Run anyway"
  • This is normal for apps without expensive code signing


STEP 4: CREATE A SHORTCUT (OPTIONAL)
-------------------------------------
For easy access:
1. Right-click "Almajd Meet.exe"
2. Select "Send to" → "Desktop (create shortcut)"
3. Now you can launch from your desktop!


STEP 5: FIRST TIME SETUP
-------------------------
1. The app will ask for camera and microphone permissions
2. Click "Allow" when prompted
3. You're ready to join meetings!

                            WHY THE SECURITY WARNING?
================================================================================

You may see "Unknown Publisher" warnings from Windows. This is NORMAL and SAFE.

Why it happens:
  • The app is not code-signed with an expensive certificate
  • This keeps the app free for you
  • The app is completely safe to use

What to do:
  • Click "More info" when you see the warning
  • Click "Run anyway"
  • Add to antivirus exclusions to prevent future blocks
